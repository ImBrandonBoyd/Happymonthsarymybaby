        Tell me something
        When the rain falls on my face
        How do you quickly replace it
        With a golden summer smile?
        Tell me something

        To make everything alright?

        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        Whoa, ooh
        Whoa, ooh
        Whoa, ooh, ooh
        I don't think that you even realize
        The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        I'll always be the lucky one
        I'll always be the lucky one
        Tell me something
        When the rain falls on my face
        How do you quickly replace it
        With a golden summer smile?
        Tell me something
        When I'm feelin' tired and afraid
        How do you know just what to say
        To make everything alright?
        I don't think that you even realize
        The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        Tell me something
        When I'm 'bout to lose control
        How do you patiently hold my hand
        And gently calm me down?
        Tell me something
        When you sing and when you laugh
        Why do I always photograph
        My heart flying way above the clouds?
        I don't think that you even realize
        The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        Whoa, ooh
        Whoa, ooh
        Whoa, ooh, ooh
        I don't think that you even realize
        The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        I'll always be the lucky one
        I'll always be the lucky one
