        Tell me something
        When the rain falls on my face
        How do you quickly replace it
        With a golden summer smile?
        Tell me something

        To make everything alright?

        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        Whoa, ooh
        Whoa, ooh
        Whoa, ooh, ooh
        I don't think that you even realize
        The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
        You can thank your stars all you want
        But I'll always be the lucky one
        You can thank your stars all you want
